Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Scientist - Physicist with more than a decade's experience in scientific research and publishing, plus I've an industry experience in Data Science Consulting of nearly 7 years now. 

Most of my repositories here are under continuous development/improvement. I'd be happy to be part of the discussion while I test/experiment. Keep watching/following as I progress!
