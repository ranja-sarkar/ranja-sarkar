I am a Scientist - Physicist with more than a decade's experience in scientific research and publishing, plus I've an industry experience of nearly 7 years in Data Science Consulting. 

My git repositories are under continuous development/improvement. I'd be happy to be part of the discussion while I experiment. Keep watching/following as I progress!

Do star ⭐ a repo, if you find it useful.😊
