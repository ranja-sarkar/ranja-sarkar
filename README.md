I am a Physicist with more than a decade's experience in scientific research and publishing.
I've an industry experience in Data Science Consulting of more than 6 years now. In 2023, I pulished a book (book repo pinned ðŸ‘‡) titled "A handbook of mathematical models with python" mainly for the business community. 

My git repositories are under continuous development/improvement. Keep watching as I progress!
I'd be happy to receive comments to them and be part of the discussion.
