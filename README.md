I am a Physicist with more than a decade's experience in scientific research and publishing. I've an industry experience of nearly 7 years in Data Science Consulting. In 2023, I published a book (repo pinned 👇) titled "A handbook of mathematical models with python" mainly for the business community. 

My git repositories are under continuous development/improvement. I'd be happy to be part of the discussion while I experiment. Keep watching/following as I progress!


Oh yes! Star ⭐ a repo if you find it useful.😊
